Python Server Metrics Scripts
=============================

This repository contains a few Python scripts that make use of
[python-server-metrics](https://github.com/bitmazk/python-server-metrics). The
data will be saved in an [InfluxDB](http://influxdb.com/) instance.

Usage
-----

Clone this repository somewhere on your server::

    cd /opt/
    git clone https://github.com/bitmazk/python-server-metrics-scripts
    cd python-server-metrics-scripts

Now prepare your ``settings.py``::

    cp settings.py.sample settings.py
    vim settings.py

Finally make sure to have dependencies installed. On a Ubuntu server, you need
something like this::

    sudo apt-get install python-dev, python-pip
    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

NOTE: You might want to create a virtual environment for this repository.

Now you should be able to testrun the scripts and results should show up in
your InfluxDB::

    python get_memory_usage.py
    python get_disk_usage.py $HOME
    python get_cpu_usage.py

Finally you will want to schedule the metrics collection via crontab:

    * * * * * python /opt/python-server-metrics-scripts/get_memory_usage.py influxdb > /opt/python-server-metrics-scripts/logs/get_memory_usage.log 2&1
    * * * * * python /opt/python-server-metrics-scripts/get_cpu_usage.py influxdb > /opt/python-server-metrics-scripts/logs/get_cpu_usage.log 2&1
    * 0 */1 * * * python /opt/python-server-metrics-scripts/get_disk_usage.py /opt/influxdb/shared/data/ > /opt/python-server-metrics-scripts/logs/get_disk_usage.log 2&1

NOTE: For some reason ``get_memory_usage.py`` returns 0 when called without
a username from crontab. It works when called from the command line. If someone
figures out how to fix this, please send a pull request :)
